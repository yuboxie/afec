The Big Bang Theory.
Ru Pauls Drag Race is life changing.
I recently finished season three of young justice and loved it, so I recommend that a lot.
Game of Thrones, if you start watching now, it's enough time to get caught up for when the last season airs in April.
The Good Place was created by Mike Schur, like The Office, Parks and Rex, B99, etc, and is legit the best show on TV rn
If you have Hulu, i recommend Letterkenny, its a little bit different from a traditional show and will take a second to get used to, but its my favorite show at the moment.
Modern family.

Example; two old ladies in waiting room at Dr office going on and on about the weather.
But I do notice sometimes how small talk can sometimes not lead to anything since its usually talking for the sake of talking.
Just to give another point of view, people with ADHD or ADD tend to struggle with small talk.
They've effectively stopped the conversation Sometimes that is the intention of saying that you don't like small talk.
You can use small talk as a segue to more meaningful topics.
I think small talk is forced, fake, and unnecessary most of the time .
I enjoy small talk.
I don't particularly enjoy small talk.
You need small talk to balance out your social interactions.
People are boring.
Additionally I feel that everyone engages in small talk.
I don't hate small talk, but I hate when a conversation never evolves past the small talk.
I don't hate it, I just don't care about any of the topics, so I never know which one to inquire about.
I don't give a fuck what traffic was like for you this morning or the game last night.
It uses up valuable social energy that I could devote to better things.
If I felt like people were genuinely listening and cared about the conversation, then it'd be different :/
I like small talks only from people i like and care about
I just think small talk is useful in keeping acquaintances.
So how is the weather?
I already have a hard enough time feeling comfortable at parties, I don't need someone asking me about my past traumas when I'm just trying to have a good time.
I mean, how would that ever come up, if no-one ever discussed last night's boring dinner?
I love small talk, I just don't know how to do it.
I rather you get to the point of the topic on why you are speaking to me."

CONGRATULATIONS!!!
That’s a big accomplishment congratulations
Congratulations!
Seems a lot of people could buy a house lately.
Congratulations!
Cheers!
What's the average price for a house there?
Oh hell yes!
Many congratulations!
This fad of using phrases like “I did a thing”, and “Adulting” make my teeth itch.
May I suggest removing a wall to make an area more open.
Great time to buy a house.
Congrats man.
Good job and good luck in the future!!
We just celebrated today after finally turning in the old keys.
I'm glad for you
Well done and congrats!
I bought mine back in February.
Hey, if you need help renovating message me.
May I ask if you know a good place to start learning about how to buy a home?
Congratulations!!!
Congratulations!
These kind of things are hard to achieve.
Do you give your ex money after divorce?
Congrats, friend!
Good for you!
Does the rent you have paid so far get/ deducted from the total amount to buy the house?
I then thought ""ugh, now I need to call someone to fix things.""
Have a happy and healthy years living there.
The first thing a house does with a new owner is get pissy with the new people.
Congrats on the purchase, double congrats on not having to move!
Cheers!
Congratulations man.
Congratulations hope you enjoy
Con grat u lations!
Good for you!
Good job and you and your kids are awesome for going through that divorce!

I just flip the camera around to be vertical!!!
I was basically fucked over from birth because of stupid decisions made by my family.
There were a lot of things that lead to a complete schism in my life.
Fuck the past.
It's been a huge theme of mine lately to re-examine my past to figure out not where it all went wrong, but why did it at no point go right.
Three schools later and second marriage.
My younger self would be proud of my older self.
Hopefully going to go back to school!
I look in the mirror and ask that everyday
I guarantee in ten years you will look back and see photos of right now and think you look handsome.
Imagining a perfect life will make you miserable, but creating a life that makes you feel content will always be better.
Start by changing your diet, fast, P90X works
You are right that reflection is important, but that one must look ahead in addition to looking backwards!
In the photographs of my childhood it seems I'm so happy and full of energy, at the end of the albums my eyes are a little bit sad, but despite that I smile a lot.
I'm still mourning all the years I lost to get to this point, though - my academic career is wreaked - so I can definitely understand that.
But either way, I’ve always been ugly always will be.
Take care.
Who knew haha?
Edna B. Mode
Im hot now.
Shit happens.
Every time I walk past a mirror.

What kinda saddens me is that life didn't get much better.

It was a wonderful day.
That's really great, I try to do this for myself as well, at least once every two weeks :)
Get a gym membership and put a workout at the end of that.
Enjoy the simple things, and actually live rather than exist!
there are other things people do on weekends that aren't fun or relaxing?..
It's great idea, I'm glad it's working for you both!
And do you think it would work as well if the one free weekend day was switched every week?
I love this idea!
Self care day does sound pretty badass tho.
Not live so you can work.
Treat yo' self.
I'm hoping summer semester will leave me some time to actually enjoy my life a bit.
Also, it recharges my whole being after consecutive days of intense interaction with people and things.
Relaxing needs to be in your life!
But last night I saw the movie Us, and just a simple night out with my friends did wonders to lift my spirit
I love this idea.
This sounds beautiful
I feel.
I’m going to talk to him about making a goal to do this one day a week like you guys ☺️
This sounds so nice!
If I take a day off and do nothing work will pile up on me a d make my next day even more miserable.
I actually just went to a small underground local funk and reggae concert and it was a party !
I felt relaxed just reading your post :)
>with his school schedule and my work schedule hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm &
That's really nice!
and I've never lived with a girlfriend, as I've been moving apartments too often for years.
Tell your loved ones to take a break every so often!
Your username made my day.
Therefore your Saturday seems so much better than mine
That sounds really nice!
My self care day is a face mask and music session with some candles.
But working constantly helps me forget how lonely I am!
I really like this!
Bruh throwing the dog is dangerous and could hurt it /s
At the risk of being downvoted for mentioning religion, the idea of a self-care non-working day is partially what the Sabbath is meant to be in Jewish/Christian religions.
I mean, it just sounds like you are taking days off rather than self care days, but I'm in support nonetheless
Sounds like a pretty normal day off.
But really sleeping all day on days we only meet and talk, I don't really wanna waste that..
Might go by the pool later as well
Wait till you have a kid... hahahahaha
My whole weekend has been filled with great friends and an exhausting convention!
Watch tv, play video games, read a trashy novel, take a walk, whatever.
Have your boyfriend listened to TAZ?
I've been studying the sabbath and we need resting time once a week the same way we need sleep every night.
Sounds like you work really well together!
Sounds a lot like the care day from parks and Recreation
Back in the olden days we called this a Sabbath lol
I love the idea of designating a day strictly for relaxation.
Oh god this is awesome.
Sounds so deflating and lame.
You really shouldn't throw the dog around, especially when your drunk.
We run constantly and have designated occasional days free of work or obligations which we call Indolence Days.
So when people say things like ""his school schedule and my work schedule"" it takes me a second not to imagine something kind of uncomfortable ...
It's a great way to spend time together at home, usually for free because ladies usually already have the items you need.
You should try finding a sauna locally."

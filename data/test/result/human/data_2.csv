We drove to a park, walked around for like an hour, and then I drove her back home.
We ate sushi and then awkwardly walked around a mall.
Even kissed me.
A proper dinner date with someone I barely knew?
My parents made me wait until I was 16 and had a license so they didn't have to provide transportation.
Dating is so much effort.

Still super good friends with her today.
Dinner and board games.
Hasn't happened yet.
It seems like Karma to me.
Went amazingly--went to dinner, then a movie, talked, smiled, held hands.
We went to see Norbit.
The entire group left me when I went to the bathroom.
The date starts off well which gives my tea time too cool.
A shame the relationship went to shit a month later
We went to the movies and watched Horrible Bosses back in 2011.
Since nothing romantic came of any of those prior times...
Actual date would be 15 or so , no parental supervision that time haha
We hung out together with friends.
We went to a park at night and drank wine while watching the night sky.
Then we decided to binge Sherlock, it must have been 3 am before we finally decided to go to bed.
We managed to get a bag of decent apples then picked clovers.
We went and got boba tea then walked around for a while.
Happy taken now though
Standard date night, went to movies and early dinner.

Congrats!
What was your starting point?
And having walking comps with people.
I don’t crave sugar, eat sugar, crash, crave sugar eat sugar anymore.
I started drinking more plain old water.
I love apple slices drenched overnight w fresh lemon so good fresh and crispy.
People really underestimate walking.
Cutting back on added sugar and eating more protein and fiber.
Carbs.
Also weight lifting can result in a lot more calories burned than most people realize.
I am now just eating when I am hungry, taking my time while eating, not worrying about eating everything, and stopping when I am no longer hungry.
Maybe even pick up a new active hobby.
Your oost comes at a perfect times, since I walk at least 10000 steps daily and my friend told me ""your steps means nothing"".
Good job btw!
I also play ultimate frisbee twice a week, but I've done that for years, it definitely helps, but the diet change was the difference maker!
Congrats on the 10 lbs lost!
I also re-evaluate the changes I’ve been making to make sure they actually feel good and not too difficult.
i removed sugar and dairy from my diet
Another one is inline skating, really fun, lots of calories, another complete workout.
Great work.

So wholesome and sweet!
First day of my internship and tonight is reserves parade night.
Good night from Australia!!
I'm gonna continue studying for the next few hours and then go meet up with my bf and some friends.
You guys gonna go to Bed Bath?
Enjoy your day of shopping.
Gonna relax the rest of day :) have a good day you all
Have a great day!
today my plans include school, then working on a music project once I get home and possibly playing some among us after that.
Single gang rise up
My new life chapter starts today!
Dang thats cute.
So I'm probably gonna make Mac n cheese today.
That sounds so cute!
Getting the final things for my camping trip I'm doing Wednesday at one of my personal favorite camp grounds, mount monadnock.
I'm hoping to get an email from a company I applied for a job at, but I usually don't get a response after I apply.
But I took a day off tomorrow, until then I'll play some guitar and sleep like a cat
I've got a couple of classes today but other than that I'm not gonna be doing much lol
No class today :)
Getting ready for my move to uni tomorrow
Haha thats cute
Bro thats so beautiful.
It's the most comforting thing in the world to sleep next to someone you love.
Hubs said some silly things in his sleep last night.
And hope ya get some good deals on your shopping spree!!
Uni campus is basically closed cause most everything to do there is closed due covid-19 etc.
My plans for today are to hopefully go back to work today.
Gotta stay indoors with all this smoke with the fires.
Morning!
Today?
I love tea.
Hate to be a downer, but if she hasn't woken up in 3 days she may not be sleeping, friend.
Try to find an internship and not fall back into depression and weed.
That must have been a moment where your heart melted :) very wholesome!
Gotta work 830a-5p, then dinner and maybe a gaming session after dinner
Damn she’s been sleeping for 3 days?
She dreamed you falling off a cliff...
Im so excited.
You are damnn lucky to have someone like that😉
Then cook a nice meal for when my girlfriend gets back from work.
God damn.
Have fun shopping, though!
I want gf
Go do my online classes, go to a store with a girl I like to look for D&D terrain, bake some cookies.
Have a great day.
Hoping to stay safe and have fun!
Good morning!
My girlfriend got a full day hangover yesterday after we went and partied for the first time in forever.
prolly dying in a hurricane Anyone else?
This is the cutest thing!
Always awkward with initiating firdt kisses.
Waiting for my boyfriend to be free so we can call, long distance sucks.
I read ""I've been waiting for her to wake up for 3 days"" and thought this was taking a dark turn
Fingers crossed.
Had an interview/meeting this morning I got stood up for and workworkwork and being jealous of you because I wish I was spending the day with my smushy instead of being a grownup.
Much better than the time my girlfriend moaned her ex boyfriends name in her sleep 😭
If that ain’t the cutest shit I’ve ever seen
She was probs thinking about murdering you...
My girlfriend did the same thing!
heck the girlfriend part.
That is proof the relationship will last
Anyway, probably some light grocery shopping, maybe some cooking, then either movie or game night.
I was like, bro, better check her into the hospital.
Wish I could say the same
Returning to the city where i study and meeting up with a beutifull person, hope everybody is doing great!
It makes me feel so loved and appreciated
So I plan to exercise and go on a hike
Today’s a beautiful day!
Today I’m working on online work for my internship for my masters and also doing homework.
Need to finish another project and hopefully sit outside with my boyfriend for a bit.
I'm in between remote classes right now, about to have lunch!
Pro Tip: make sure your side dish has the same name as the main course
She was dreaming about talking to the hit man she hired...
Fuck you and your happiness
Your suppose to put your dick in her mouth while she calls you ur name in sleep.
This morning I filled some boxes from Ikea with stuff I'll take to my uni house, currently I'm studying while listening to ASMR singing ice breaking.
Smart woman, she found a side dude with the same name!
That's crazy my girlfriend was petrified and in a coma and started muttering something.
Helium sourcing
After that despite the smoke in my area I will probably end up taking a walk to clear my head.
#CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Wholesome af
My girlfriend did something similar last night .
Hoovered my room and bathroom.
wholesome :)
I recently started working towards regaining my fitness again and losing some weight.
Yeah good morning to you too.
Reminds me of the time my 3 year old daughter laughed in her sleep then said ‘mmm, Daddy’ with a smile.
I’m doing online classes and zoom calls today, then I’m just gonna do nothing and chill.
Sounds like a moment you won't forget for a long time!
And then actual work
If my wife did this, I'd be terrified.
better than her saying her boyfriends name.
If I just wasn't a virgin
Love the story.
Hey op.
And mine just screams about spiders.
Are you sure you're the only person with your name in her life?
She hasn't woken up for 3 days?
sitting at work hoping this hurricane won’t wipe me out
Today has been abnormally busy.
Aww thats just adorable make sure to treat her well
Obviously it means nothing, but still made me feel bad ☹️
Gotta make good use of my last week of summer vacation, lol.

Never grew out of gaming but my tastes in games have certainly changed over the years from when I first started
Maybe try a new genre you've never played before.
Some people get bored of games.
I kinda stopped playing FIFA as much over the last couple of years, but i was never massively into gaming in general.
I work full time and go to school part time, the little bit of time I can spend playing games is earned and enjoyed.
TL:DR Big game developers are shitting out cookie cutter games over and shoving down our throats.
I don't play video games as much as I'd like right now, but I'd certainly consider video games, as lame as it sounds, a bit of a passion of mine in some regard.
It sounds like you have stuck with similar genres in the past.

Still looks fine and plays fantastically.
The soundtrack for AC will never die.
I remember when I first booted up Tekken Tag Tournament 2, I was in awe of how it looked.
Turns out it CAN play XBOX 360 games with no problem.
I played Star Wars Galaxies and never noticed the graphics.
I always and always will have the same thought of nostalgia in my mind about GTA : SA on the Xbox.
Our imaginations fill in the details!
First time that happened to me was Grand Theft Auto III.
The game looks so good even though it's released 13 years ago.
You can't truly imagine the clarity of the future before you've seen it.
Anyone remember Myst?
Exactly like that.
Oh boy I should totally pull out age of empires haha..
I tried emulating Wild World a few months back.
The terran units aren't even recognizably human, lol.
Yet the T-Rex scene in the original Jurassic Park will never age.
I remember thinking the Bionicle movie was real when I was little.
Anybody remember spore for the DS?
Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn?
Dude Halo: CE was fucking dope on xbox original holy shit the nostalgia
I play Dota 2, and a few days ago I tried playing the original Defense of the Ancients, which required the Warcraft III client.
I wanted to play Midtown Madness after 15 years because I used to consider it a high quality looking game back when I was in kindergarten.
Standards and expectations go up the more we get use to the new stuff.
just when you think games can't get any more beautiful, they shock and surprise you.
It's still a favorite of mine, though.
That's why someone I knew once said to never watch a TV with better resolution than you have at someone else's house.
I remember getting really excited when I saw smoke coming out the exhaust of a semi truck in GTA 4.
I remember playing Final Fantasy XIII back when it came out and thinking it looked incredible and so life-like.
Haha, yeah.
I remember when Frogger looked realistic.
There was this one off-road racing game I played a lot as a kid, mostly because it was one of very few games that would actually run on PowerPC Macs.
Graphics improve so much every generation that everything before it looks like a cartoon.
Hmm, not sure I'd use Animal Crossing as an example for a realistic game.
i missed my old ww town and it was so funny to see how everything is so boxy and weird compared to new leaf!
Hollywood will remake every crappy movie ever shoved out, but gaming companies won't remake my childhood games.
Old games look much better on CRT screens.
The cars in Gran Turismo Sport look borderline photorealistic, but when I was a kid, I thought Need For Speed Carbon was the peak of graphic achievements lol
I couldn't see things getting noticeably better than that in the next 10 years.
I'm also playing Animal crossing New Leaf
I could see blankets on the frick'n beds.
Once you play a great game, no matter it's age, long enough you disregarded the graphics long ago and are still immersed.
Go back to any game you used to love as a child, a game that immersed you before fancy 3D graphics.
One game that hold up surprisingly well is Mass Effect.
I want to experience old things with the wonder we used to have.
Even scaled up on a 4k, it could have felt way worse.
I never had the impression of games looking realistic more just good for the time.
I can still go back, but all the new titles look like how I imagined the old titles did then."

fb1v046","Often I think to myself I fall in real love only all 7 years.
You are a kind person.
Sounds fun.
I like that happy feeling that comes when I see them walk into a room.
I get crushes on people all the time.
You're not the only person, and you're breathtaking.
Super sweet and talkative.
This was super enlightening, kinda made me realize a lot about how I work as a person haha.
I love the casual crush, it's usually fun and harmless and less anxiety inducing than the real thing :D
Living in the present.
I find that i look to find pieces of people to pick out and appreciate and get little mini crushes!
it makes me feel less alone in my affections for people.
It makes the world seem more joyful
That sounds sweet.
Everyone wins.
I hate having crushes on people who wont like me back.
But I guess not everyone thinks like this
I like you for this.
I'm always like this.
I relate to this a lot and also have a lot of casual crushes!
It let's me feel like a teenager, but without the bullshit.
You are a beautiful person.
Being around a crush adds a nice little buzz to your day.
That reminds me of the song 'Someone New' by Hozier
It kind of makes me excited for the day and gives me something to look forward to.
bro you're looking kinda cute today
It’s just our nature.
Idk if it's the same thing I fall in love with people really easily, and lose interest as fast or faster
Crushes are not very pleasant at this level.
This is so relatable
This ones a bit weird to me.
Another person is made of so many different quirks and moods and habits and being allowed to meet the real them is beautiful.
""I fall in love just a little ol' little bit Every day with someone new""
Something in this post is beautiful and enlightened my day!
I get these silly work crushes and they're the best.
I have office crushes, coffee shop crushes, I even used to have a crush on someone I always cycled past on the way to my old job.
I think it is healthy to have little crushes and be crushed on
OMG i am totally like this.
What, really?
YES!
I'm, for the most part, much happier as a single person and enjoy being able to have little crushes on friends and strangers every so often.
I relate hard to this
I have casual crushes all the time!!
I totally get you!
This is exactly how i've been feeling lately, i just didnt know how to put it iinto words!
I'm realising lately I have a small crush on one of my colleagues.
Doesn’t *ever* work out well for myself.
This is super nice
Great music
I do this from time to time as well.
l changed.
Never really had micro crushes.
Hey guys, I found crazy.
I keep developing light crushes on random girls!
I never thought about this....
Oh hey!
Or for it to go south, to lose face maybe even lose a friend?
I can relate one hundred percent.
I thought it was weird, and I never knew anyone else who has/ enjoys this.
Unfourtunately for me my “casual crushes” evolve into an obsession :(
Having crushes make life less boring
Low self esteem also doesn't help
Literally today I just told someone I liked her.
This is actually so cute
I used to call them my secret crushes when I was over dating for years after a bad relationship.
Yes!
Dats real cute
Or something like that, it was a couple years ago.
Although, I feel like I almost categorize them as like, a friend crush, as in I would love to be bffs with this person.
Oh man, I thought I was a total weirdo.
I just feel like it makes people feel loved and cherished.
This made me smile
Just dont be the person that gets peoples hopes up for no reason :)
What a beautiful being.
Omg yes!
*raspberry noise.
It makes it awfully easy to talk to someone at work .
I hate my inability to not form crushes all the time
Though i talk to guys more.
I suggest you read Out of the Shadows.
It's really nice to be a little in love
As an anxious introvert, this sounds like being friends with someone
Don’t u ever think your leading people on?
I think this weird cringe calling out is going to make some people not express those small, fun crushes for fear of ending up in creepypms.
Interesting.
Crushes with boundaries.
You should listen to - Someone New by Hozier.
The fuck?
Updoot for wholesome
Would look bad at work
I like saying I *love* love.
Ah, I've always justified these as just admiration for a person or a wild imagination.
But I love crushing.
Bi bitches
It’s absolutely wonderful.
It’s a really refreshing feeling.
Whatever your feeling is, you can NEVER be the only one.
You might never know how much it could mean to someone.
Saaaame.
I enjoy flirty banter that makes me blush.
Oh my god this made me feel so much better.
wtf?
Actually, this is adorable, and I totally get it.
It makes me feel alive.
It's nice because one of my go to moves is giving a massage.
This is lovely.
She leaves me on read alot
I agree.
I kinda stopped doing that once I got to college though.
Reading this made my day because of just how damn pure and wholesome it is.
I actually hate casual crushes.
Same, happens all the time both IRL and online.
At lease this would be my reaction haha
Reality is, it gives me happiness and with someone like me, I rarely get happiness.
Great post.
I sometimes felt unjust to feel this.
Oh shit, I think I just found something that I could never really describe about myself.
Chances are high you know.
This is weird af ngl
Wow, I felt like I'm reading how I think.
I think it could look creepy if I did it.
if this is a casual crush - It seems like I have a casual crush on everyone i run into.
And ""newness"" in a brand spanking new relationship.
Ah damn I thought I was the only one to have married half of my uni
I have a crush on you just by reading on your post OP
I completely resonate with you mate.
The one crush I did get just felt so fun.
You just enjoy life.
There's no one to like atm hahhaha
Thank you
Is it possible to learn this power?
I’m having my first experiences with this feeling, and I’m so much happier than when I used to take the “hopeless romantic” route.
This is probably the most stupid thing I've read today.
People spend their lives trying to find this, but they don't even know that this is what they are looking for.
I like having crushes, i like liking people.
Well put!
I think this is just normal human behavior lol
Ever get your heart broken by a casual crush?
I have a huge crush on that girl from 2 years ago.
I thought that most of the most beautiful live stories were always between yourself and a stranger you never get to be with.
Lol this post has naivety written all over it.
that's ok sometimes, but just make sure you don't date them unless you actually full on like them.
I wish I felt like this."

I've driven across the US with friends and no real goal other than a final destination and had a great time.
I actually prefer traveling alone.
Definitely.
I absolutely loved travelling alone, I travelled alone in Hanoi, Vietnam and also in Warsaw, Poland.
Definitely.
I will definitely recommend traveling alone.
I've done solo travel many times over the past decade.
Follow that gut feeling.
Also, ""table for one"" gets really old.
I have done it quite a bit."

I've seen it happen.
So many cars.
Better yet, a cruise ship.
Mowing down the hordes with mall music playing in the background is mad satisfying.
Alone in the Wilderness like Dick Proenecke.
But what if the zombies are *IN* the mall
2) On back country trail crews.
That sounds like it would be a great place
If a zombies outbreak happens im taking over a Costco to secure food and stuff then invade a Lowes to get geared up for a final assault on the National guard armory
many points of entry, no clear lines of escape due to being an isolated building, limited vertical advantage, if zed break in one door they pour into the whole building uninhibited...
Forming a sizable community would be your best bet to survive, because in scenarios where government collapses, bigger gangs always win.
That's why there are so many movies that do this ;)"

I find something bigger and more important to do so I can procrastinate on that.
Also, knuckles on trying to learn programming.
I remind myself that I will feel so much better after I do it, and that my leisure time will feel much more rewarding after accomplishing something.
Coffee helps.
Break things down into very, very small sections and never try to do more than one at a time.
I'm not good at staying focused, so I mainly try to work under pressure as that seems to help me focus more.
